[TERM PROJECT] Rat-in-a Maze
by Pam Janier

For this program, the user will be given two options: open a maze file or create a new maze. 
If the user picks to open a maze file, the program will read and solve maze.txt. On the other hand, if the user wants to create a maze from scratch, it will ask the user to enter the maze size and the program will solve it. 
The path of the maze will be printed showing how it was found using BFS and DFS.
